# ✨ MasterJaneza V2 | Neon Text Card UI

Welcome to **Version 2** of the "Image Behind Text" concept — now reimagined with a dark, cyber-glass aesthetic, animated gradients, and glowing text. No JavaScript. No frameworks. Just raw **HTML + CSS** beauty.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases a modern UI component — a glowing glassmorphic card with layered text effects and subtle animations. It's perfect for developer portfolios, landing pages, hero sections, or anywhere you want to flex a bit of design finesse.
